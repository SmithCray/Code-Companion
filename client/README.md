## üßê <span style="color:royalblue">**Description:**</span>

[Code-Companion]("add deployed") is a web app that allows Users to team up with people around the world to work on coding projects and share their experience. Our application allows you to post projects you are looking for partners on, join projects other users have posted. User's can also build a custom profile which lets them list all of their relevant skills, accomplishments, and years/months of experience. In addition projects also have specifics on skills/experience as well as what language/stack they are using and or looking for.

### <span style="color:lightblue">**User Story:**</span>

<br>

As a User

        I want a website I can go to as a new or experienced programmer to find people to partner with and work on various coding projects with others.

Then

        I want a list of projects other users are looking for teammates to help create with specifics on language/stack as well as an option to post new projects you are looking for team members on.

So that

        I can continue learning and growing my skill set and network with other programmers that can help mentor me or I can help mentor them depending on experience level.
